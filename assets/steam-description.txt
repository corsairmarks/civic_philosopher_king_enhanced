[h1]Overview[/h1]
Like the idea of enlightened authoritarian rulers with Civic: Philosopher King but feel a bit underwhelmed at its actual affects?  Then this mod is for you!  It lightly enhances Civic: Philospher King to have effects similar to those added to Civic: Distinguished Admiralty in Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra:" Rulers and Governors begin with +2 levels.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Adds two events that grant bonus levels to Rulers and Governors for empires with Civic: Philosopher King.  Overwrites the built-in localisation for Civic: Philosopher King to describe this added effect.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Any mod that does not remove Civic: Philosopher King.

[h2]Localisation[/h2]
The text describing the effects for Civic: Philosopher King has been edited to describe its new effect in for each of the eight officially-supported Stellaris languages.  I'm reasonably confident in my splicing for most languages, although I may have used the wrong word for "and" in Chinese.
