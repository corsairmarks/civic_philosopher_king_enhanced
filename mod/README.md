# Overview

Like the idea of enlightened authoritarian rulers with Civic: Philosopher King but a bit underwhelmed at its actual affects?  Then this mod is for you!  It lightly enhances Civic: Philospher King to have effects similar to those added to Civic: Distinguished Admiralty in Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra:" Rulers and Governors begin with +2 levels.

# Changes

Adds two events to grant bonus levels to Rulers and Governors for empires with Civic: Philosopher King, overwrite built-in localisation for Civic: Philosopher King to describe this added effect.  Also added an even when the game starts to grant the initial Ruler for Civic: Philosopher King an additional level (in line with standard empires, which start with level 2 initial Rulers).

## Compatibility

Any mod that does not remove Civic: Philosopher King.

### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.
